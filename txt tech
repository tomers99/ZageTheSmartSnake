The number of fov points is 18 * 18 = 324.
The number of weights per point is 5 * 4 = 20.
therefore, each "creature" has 32,400 "genes".

According to Python (which, I think, is lying!), step 1 sim takes about 2.5 seconds to run.

- Optimizations:
1. Reduce fov jump/ fov diameter.
2. Head is stuck --> calculate score and exit.
3. Numpy for numeric calculations.
4. Parallelism.
5. Increase head's speed?
6. Reduce game time?
7. Reduce game board?

- Things I want to do:
1. Add border score penalty.
